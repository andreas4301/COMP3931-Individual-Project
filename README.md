# COMP3931 - Individual Project
First Steps Towards Creating a Digital Twin of a Cloud Data Centre

This repository contains the Unity files and components required for our project to run.
On Unity Hub, click on "Open" then choose the folder that includes the files in this repository and click on "Open". That should open our Unity project.
Keep in mind that for the implementation to run the VMWare Workstation Player API server should be running. To do that, go to the VMware installation path in your device, click on the "VMware Player" folder and then on "vmrest.exe".
